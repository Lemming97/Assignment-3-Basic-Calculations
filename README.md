<p><b>Part 1: Using a Products Form</b>
<br>(Like A2P2 except with NO alerts, NO prompts, and NO document.writes!)</p>
<p><b>Part 2: Make it Functional</b>
<br>(Display the person’s name and what they ordered.  And do it with a function!)</p>
<p><b>Part 3: You Receive A Receipt</b>
<br>What to do: Process the order by calculating subtotals, total, and showing detailed receipt. 
How to code it: Receipt is done using “innerHtml”. The event (and function call) is no longer triggered from within the button – it is now triggered by an “addEventListener” in a script at the bottom in the page that activates your “processOrder” function which is still in the “head”:

<p><b>Part 4: Change Your Prices and Pay Your Taxes</b>
<br>What to do: Change your prices to include dollars and cents, add an 8% tax charge to the receipt, show a subtotal, tax, and grand total. Show 2 decimal places on ALL money. 
How to code it: Change prices by changing your 2 global price constants in the “head”. Use “toFixed” to display all money to 2 decimal places everywhere it is displayed on the page.  Receipt is still done using “innerHtml”, prices shown within the form still done with document.write (no change from part 2).
